# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Users can create short posts of up to 140 characters and have them append to the main page. Posts are sequential, with the most recent posts appearing at the top of the page. To do so, Tweeter fetches a list of posts from a simplified ‘server’ and allows users to add posts to this list dynamically. All requests will be made asynchronously.
